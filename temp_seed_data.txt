Taylor Swift
Willow

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Taylor Swift
Champagne Problems

[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom

Justin Bieber
Holy

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

Blinding Lights

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Duh-duh-duh, duh, duh, duh
As he falls back deeper, into a state
The return (Dot Da Genius, baby)
(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

[Verse 1]
Nights my mind is speedin' by, I'm holdin' on
Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
Lord seein' me swerve
Do this to my loved ones, I've got some nerve
Don't think I'm not sorry

[Chorus]
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Post-Chorus]
Hm, I been here before
Hm, hm, I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
As the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Verse 2]
(Yeah) Standin' on the cliff right off Mulholland Drive
(Yeah) Back up on my late night session remedy
(Oh) Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
See, it seems I'll never learn
I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Post-Chorus]
I been here before, hey, hey
I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
And the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

Suppose you got two hoes that go both ways, don't know my limit
Know what it is, fall into the void, this how I'm livin'
Can't ask for better options, it's the captain of the ship isn't it?
Yeah, yo, this for my sanity
Some play some days into the night
I say you can't judge me, babe, I'm twisted in the brain, know why (Yeah)
See I can't be stressin' (No, no, I can't stress)

Baby, come and learn these lessons (Come, baby, and see)
Been around and around again (Boom-boom, boom-boom)
Cuttin' loose with the troops and, no, we ain't lie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done "specially invited guest"'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward

Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and-

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
(Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward)
Movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Something was wrong (Keep movin' forward)
Couldn't hold on, why? (Keep movin' forward)
So long (Keep movin' forward)
Sit here in this storm (Keep movin' forward)
Time goes on (Keep movin' forward)
Really couldn't find my way out (Keep movin' forward)
Of the storm (Keep movin' forward)
Which way do I go?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm soâI'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
